\mainpage Introduction to MG-Tetra plug-in

MG-Tetra plug-in adds two meshing algorithm to the SALOME Mesh: 
\b MG-Tetra (former GHS3D) and <b>MG-Tetra Optimization</b>.

\b MG-Tetra meshing algorithm is destined for:
  - Meshing 3D geometric entities: solids are split into tetrahedral (pyramidal) elements.
  - Generating 3D meshes from 2D meshes (triangles and quadrangles), working without geometrical objects.

<b>MG-Tetra Optimization</b> algorithm optimizes linear tetrahedral
meshes not based on geometry. 
- To be able to optimize a mesh generated on geometry, copy
this mesh (menu <b>Mesh > Copy Mesh</b>) and assign MG-Tetra
Optimization algorithm to the new mesh in <b>Edit Mesh</b> dialog.
- To re-optimize a just optimized mesh, invoke <b>Clear Mesh
  Data</b> command and then \b Compute the mesh again.

\note MG-Tetra plug-in uses MG-Tetra commercial mesher and requires a
license to be used within the Mesh module.
To obtain a license, visit http://www.meshgems.com/meshgems-products.html

To manage parameters of the MG-Tetra mesher use 
\subpage ghs3d_hypo_page and \subpage additional_hypo_page. 
Parameters of MG-Tetra Optimization can be managed via \subpage optimization_page.

Also all MG-Tetra functionalities are accessible via
\subpage ghs3dplugin_python_interface_page "MG-Tetra Python interface".
