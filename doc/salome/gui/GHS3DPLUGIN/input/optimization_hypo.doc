\section mgtetra_optim_gen_params General parameters

\image html mgtetra_optim_gen_params.png

- <b>Name</b> - allows to define the name of the hypothesis (MG-Tetra
Parameters by default).

- <b>Optimization</b> - sets the optimisation type. If <b>Optimization</b> is:
  - No : no optimisation is applied
  - Yes (default): optimisation is performed upon mesh generation using
          the <b>Optimisation level</b> parameter 
  - Only : only optimisation is performed to an existing mesh.

- <b>Optimization level</b> - allows choosing the required
optimization level (higher level of optimization provides better mesh,
but can be time-consuming):
  - none
  - light
  - medium (standard)
  - standard+
  - strong

- <b>Split overconstrained elements</b> - sets treatment of element
having all their vertices on the input surface. 
If <b>Split overconstrained elements</b> is:
  - No (default): no correction is applied
  - Yes : correction is applied upon mesh generation
  - Only : only correction is applied to an existing mesh.

- <b>PThreads mode</b> - sets optimization mode when using multithread
capabilities. Valid values are:
  - Safe : slower but quality can only get better
  - Aggressive : faster but quality may be altered
  - None (default): not activated.

- <b>Max number of threads</b> - sets the maximum number of threads to
be used in parallel.

- <b>Smooth off sliver elements</b> - activates elimination of sliver
elements as much as possible.

- <b>Create new nodes</b> - allows insertion of new nodes.

\subsection memory_settings Memory settings

- <b>Initial memory size</b> - starts MG-Tetra software with
the specified amount of work space, in Mbytes. If this option is checked off, the
software will be started with 100 Megabytes of working space.

- <b>Maximum memory size</b> - launches MG-Tetra software with
work space limited to the specified amount of RAM, in Mbytes. If this option is
checked off, the software will be launched with 7O% of the total RAM space.

\subsection log Logs and debug

- <b>Working directory</b> - allows defining the folder for input and output
files of MG-Tetra software, which are the files starting with "GHS3D_" prefix.

- <b>Verbose level</b> - to choose verbosity level in the range from
0 to 10.

  - 0, no standard output,

  - 2, prints the data, quality statistics of the skin and final
  meshes and indicates when the final mesh is being saved. In addition
  the software gives indication regarding the CPU time.

  - 10, same as 2 plus the main steps in the computation, quality
  statistics histogram of the skin mesh, quality statistics histogram
  together with the characteristics of the final mesh.
  
- <b>Print log in a file</b> - if this option is checked on the log is
printed in a file placed in the working directory, otherwise it is
printed on the standard output.

- <b>Remove log on success</b> - if this option is checked on the log
file is kept only if an error occurs during the computation. This
option is only available if <b>Print log in a file</b> is enabled
(there must be a log file to delete it) and <b>Keep all working
  files</b> is disabled (in this case the log file is always kept).

- <b>Keep all working files</b> - allows checking input and output
files of MG-Tetra software, while usually these files are removed
after the launch of the mesher. The log file (if any) is also kept if
this option is checked.

\subsection advanced_meshing_options Advanced meshing options

- A table allows to input in the command line any text for MG-Tetra,
for example, advanced options.<br> 

- <b>Add option</b> - adds a line to the table where you can type an
option and its value as text. A check box in the first column
activates/deactivates the option of the current row. A deactivated
option will be erased upon pressing \a Ok.

<br><b>See Also</b> a sample TUI Script of the 
\ref tui_ghs3d "creation of a MG-Tetra Optimization hypothesis".
