- <b>Name</b> - allows to define the name of the hypothesis (MG-Tetra
Parameters by default).

- <b>Mesh holes</b> - if checked, the algorithm will 
create mesh in the holes inside a solid shape, else only the outermost
shape will be meshed. Volumic elements created within holes are bound
to the solid.

- <b>Make groups of domains</b> - if checked, the algorithm will
create groups of just generated elements corresponding to each mesh
domain.<br>

- <b>Optimization level</b> - allows choosing the required
optimization level (higher level of optimization provides better mesh,
but can be time-consuming):

  - none

  - light

  - medium (standard)

  - standard+

  - strong

\subsection memory_settings Memory settings

- <b>Maximum memory size</b> - launches MG-Tetra software with
work space limited to the specified amount of RAM, in Mbytes. If this option is
checked off, the software will be launched with 7O% of the total RAM space.

- <b>Initial memory size</b> - starts MG-Tetra software with
the specified amount of work space, in Mbytes. If this option is checked off, the
software will be started with 100 Megabytes of working space.

\subsection log Logs and debug

- <b>Working directory</b> - allows defining the folder for input and output
files of MG-Tetra software, which are the files starting with "GHS3D_" prefix.

- <b>Verbose level</b> - to choose verbosity level in the range from
0 to 10.

  - 0, no standard output,

  - 2, prints the data, quality statistics of the skin and final
  meshes and indicates when the final mesh is being saved. In addition
  the software gives indication regarding the CPU time.

  - 10, same as 2 plus the main steps in the computation, quality
  statistics histogram of the skin mesh, quality statistics histogram
  together with the characteristics of the final mesh.
  
- <b>Print log in a file</b> - if this option is checked on the log is printed in a 
file placed in the working directory, otherwise it is printed on the standard output.

- <b>Remove log on success</b> - if this option is checked on the log file is kept only
if an error occurs during the computation. This option is only available if <b>Print log in a file</b>
is enabled (there must be a log file to delete it) and <b>Keep all working files</b> is disabled 
(in this case the log file is always kept). 

- <b>Keep all working files</b> - allows checking input and output files
of MG-Tetra software, while usually these files are removed after the
launch of the mesher. The log file (if any) is also kept if this option is checked.

\subsection advanced_meshing_options Advanced meshing options

- <b>Create new nodes</b> - if this option is checked off, MG-Tetra
tries to create tetrahedrons using only the nodes of the 2D mesh.

- <b>Remove the initial central point</b> MG-Tetra adds an internal point 
at the gravity center of the bounding box to speed up and to simplify 
the meshing process. However, it is possible to refrain from creating 
this point by using the command line option -no initial central point. This can be
particularly useful to generate a volume mesh without internal points at all and in some rare cases
at the boundary regeneration phase when it is impossible to proceed
with the standard options
(for example, when one dimension of the domain is more than 20 times greater than the other two).
Use this option if the boundary regeneration has failed with the standard parameters and before using
the recovery version (command line option -C).
Note: when using this option, the speed of the meshing process may
decrease, and the quality may change.
Note: the boundary regeneration may fail with this option, in some rare cases.

- <b>Use boundary recovery version</b> - enables using a
boundary recovery module which tries to
create volume meshes starting from very poor quality surface meshes
(almost flat triangles on the surface, high density propagation,
extreme aspect ratios, etc.) which fails with the standard version. The
resulting volume mesh will however most likely have a very poor
quality (poor aspect ratio of elements, tetrahedra with a very small
positive volume).

- <b>Use FEM correction</b> - Applies finite-element correction by 
replacing overconstrained elements where it is possible. At first the process 
slices the overconstrained edges and at second the overconstrained 
facets. This ensures that there are no edges with two boundary
vertices and that there are no facets with three boundary vertices. MG-Tetra gives the initial 
and final overconstrained edges and facets. It also gives the facets
which have three edges on the boundary.
Note: when using this option, the speed of the meshing process may 
decrease, quality may change, and the smallest volume may be smaller.
By default, the FEM correction is not used.

- <b>Volumic gradation</b> - Defines the volumic ratio between 2 consecutive elements.
WARNING: Changing the default value of this parameter may dramatically decrease the quality of the resulting mesh.

- A table at the page bottom allows to input in the command line any text
for MG-Tetra, for example, advanced options. <br> 
<b>Add option</b> - adds a line to the table where you can type an option and its value as text.
A check box in the first column activates/deactivates the option of the current row. A deactivated option will be erased upon pressing \a Ok.

\section ghs3d_enforced_vertices Enforced vertices

\image html ghs3d_enforced_vertices.png

MG-Tetra algorithm can locally make the mesh finer. It is possible to
define enforced vertices in the volume where the mesh will be detailed.
A node will be created at the enforced vertex coordinates.

An enforced vertex is defined by:
- A vertex
  - from GEOM (Vertex, Compound) - only available on meshes with no
  geometry attached
  - or from (x,y,z) Cartesian coordinates
- A constant physical size. If this size is zero, then the mesh size is
not affected.
- If a group name is given, the created node will be added to the
group. If the group does not exist, it is created.

\section ghs3d_enforced_meshes Enforced Meshes

\image html ghs3d_enforced_meshes.png

MG-Tetra algorithm can be forced by other meshes, sub-meshes or
groups. The constraint elements should be contained
entirely into the solid mesh.
- The constraint element types are:
  - NODE
  - EDGE
  - FACE
- If a group name is given, the enforced elements will be added to
the group. If the group does not exist, it is created.
